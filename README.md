## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site: <https://meet-landing-page-jade-ten.vercel.app/>
- Source Code: <https://github.com/VictorDuranEM/meet-landing-page>

## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first project using Next.js. I'm getting familiar with the way Next.js builds a project and serves it to the browser. Since this project is a simple landing page, SSG is being used to generate the HTML at build time for the production deployment in Vercel.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to include data fetching so learn how to use the getStaticProps and getServerSideProps functions.
